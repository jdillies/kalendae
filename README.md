The purpose of this Google Apps Script is to generate an email with the upcoming events in a selected list of calendars.
The original motivation was to create a weekly digest of upcoming events in our department where the seminars are listed as google calendars.
Together with a weekly trigger and a google group, this script is used to diffuse a weekly email of seminars to come.
